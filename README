## Implementation Details
- The program reads files **byte by byte** and prints them in formatted output.
- Non-printable characters are replaced with `.` (ASCII hex `2E`).
- Uses `ifstream` for reading files in **binary mode**.
- Handles errors (e.g., file not found).

## Files Included
- `xed.cpp` - Main source code
- `Makefile` - Compilation instructions
- `README` - This file

## Notes
- Ensure the file exists before running the program.
- Only **regular files** are supported (no directories, symlinks, or special files).
